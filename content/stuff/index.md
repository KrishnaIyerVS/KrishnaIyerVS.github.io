A collection of relatively obscure software, scripts and other stuff I wrote/use that might prove useful to other people.

#### My Stuff

- [Vim-Cytosim](https://github.com/KrishnaIyerVS/vim-cytosim): Vim syntax-highlighting plugin for Cytosim config files

#### Software

- [Ipe](https://ipe.otfried.org/): Quite the learning curve, but one of the best software I've used for quick mathematical diagrams.
